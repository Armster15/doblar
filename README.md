# [Doblar](https://doblar.armaan.cc)
Doblar is a fully local image converter that runs in your browser. Doblar is purely client side: nothing is uploaded to a server or anything like that. All conversions take place in your browser, which means your files never leave your computer.

On the more technical side, the magic to this is [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/), which is awesome.

## Improvements that could be made
- Finding a smaller WASM library for converting files. Currently the WASM build is ~18MB, a size which is not very pretty for websites!
- More glittery PWA stuff
- Maybe add more formats in the future, instead of just images. Will require a huge time investment though, and I am incredibly busy these days :(
- Better accessibility. So far it is very, very bare and I am trying to make an effort to make my projects more accessible to everyone.

## What does the name mean?
"doblar" means "to turn" in Spanish
